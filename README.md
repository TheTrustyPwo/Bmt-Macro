<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is a rather simple Python script which makes use of Selenium's ability
to interact with the web browser to automatically book badminton courts on
<a href="https://www.mesrc.net/">mesrc.net</a> which are free of charge.

Some awesome features:
* Lightweight
* Runs in the background
* Automatic execution at any time you want
* Instant setup and configurable

<!-- CONFIGURATION -->
## Configuration

This is a list of configurable options in the `config.json` file and what they mean.

| Configurable | Description                                                                                                                                                                                        | Default      | Datatype |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|----------|
| `headless`   | If set to true, the browser will be invisible which will possibly increases performance and reduce unnecessary lag.                                                                                | false        | bool     |
| `debug`      | If set to true, debug messages will be printed. Screenshots will also be taken of the full webpage, but this requires headless to be enabled to work properly                                      | false        | bool     |
| `execute`    | The specific date and time to execute the script, i.e. start booking. Usually, you would want to set this to midnight and run the script overnight. It MUST be in the format `DD/MM/YYYY hh:mm:ss` | -            | str      |
| `date`       | Date which you want to book. It MUST be in the format `DD/MM/YYYY`.                                                                                                                                | -            | str      |
| `time_start` | The time you want to start playing. It MUST be an integer representing the hour in 24-hour format. (i.e. 7am is 7, 6pm is 18, etc.)                                                                | 10           | int      |
| `time_end`   | The time you want to stop playing. It MUST be an integer representing the hour in 24-hour format. (i.e. 7am is 7, 6pm is 18, etc.) Keep in mind that the maximum duration is 2 hours.              | 12           | int      |
| `purpose`    | This option should not really matter, but it is required in the booking form, and it represents your purpose. (i.e. Recreational, Competitive, etc.)                                               | Recreational | str      |
| `pax`        | This option should not really matter, but it is required in the booking form, and it represents the number of expected people that will be present.                                                | 4            | int      |
